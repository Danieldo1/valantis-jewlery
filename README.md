## Introduction

This repository houses a trial project developed as part of a job application process. The application showcases the ability to interact with a provided server, processing and displaying data in a user-friendly manner. The key functionality includes making API calls using Axios, handling data with care to remove duplicates, and presenting the information through a responsive interface built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

-   **API Integration:**  Utilizes Axios to fetch data from the server, including product IDs and detailed information.
-   **Data Processing:**  Implements logic to eliminate duplicate IDs and efficiently handle data for further requests.
-   **Pagination:**  Supports pagination with a limit, displaying 50 items per page to enhance user experience.
-   **Dynamic Filtering:**  Allows users to filter products by price through an input field.
-   **Sorting Capability:**  Enables users to sort products by brand via a dropdown selection.
-   **High-Performance UI:**  Leverages Next.js for server-side rendering and Tailwind CSS for a polished, responsive design.
